    "- To remove encryption from the pdf\n",
    "- To remove the layering in the pdf\n",

    "- To remove security headers in the pdf\n",

    "- A new pdf is generated which can be used to upload on website, which do not accept the pdf's with digital security headers or multiple layered pdf's.\n",
    "- Secure as it is offline and no data will be uploaded anywhere. Best method if you prefer privacy.\n",
